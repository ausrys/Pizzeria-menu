The app:
Pizza menu app where you can add pizzas in to a pizza menu, you have to input a unique pizza name, the heat of the pizza which is counted by chillie peppers and you have to choose at least 2 toppings for the pizza. On submit pizza is added in to the list and saved in to a session storage. On deleting the pizza from the menu, user is asked to confirm the decision. 
Requirements for the pizza form:
Unique pizza name
Heat 1-3
Price from 10-99
At least 2 toppings

The task was not complete to the end. The chosen method made sorting by price and heat harder, so it was not achieved. An option to add photo the pizza was not done, because hard coding images was out of my expertese.
